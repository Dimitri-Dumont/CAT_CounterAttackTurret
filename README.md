# CAT (Counter Attack Turret)

An IoT-powered cat training system that uses computer vision and motion detection(future upgrade) to keep cats off countertops! When a feline intruder is detected, the system precisely aims and delivers a deterrent water spray. Built with Raspberry Pi, this automated solution helps train your cats while you're away - death to dirty countertops!
